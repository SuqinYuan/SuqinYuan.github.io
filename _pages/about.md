# About me

I am a PhD student at [Sydney Artificial Intelligence Centre](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/data-science-and-computer-engineering/ubtech-sydney-artificial-intelligence-centre.html), University of Sydney, supervised by [Prof. Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io). 

I am particularly interested in exploring the interpretability of artificial neural networks and the human brain. 
Recently, I have been focusing on Deep Learning Generalization in Limitation Environment. I suggest treating deep neural networks entirely as a black-box and based on this, studying the generalization of deep neural networks. Drawing inspiration from animal ethology, I refer to this method as 'Model Ethology'.
