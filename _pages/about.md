# About me

I am a PhD student at [Sydney Artificial Intelligence Centre](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/data-science-and-computer-engineering/ubtech-sydney-artificial-intelligence-centre.html), [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au), primarily advised by Prof. [Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io). I am also receiving valuable advice from Prof. [Lei Feng](https://lfeng1995.github.io) of [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg). I regularly serve as a reviewer for ICLR, NeurIPS, UAI, AISTATS, ACM MM, etc.

Lately, my primary focus has been on “Generalization in Deep Learning within Constrained Environments.” All my work is dedicated to promoting machine learning models that can effectively and efficiently generalize on large-scale, imperfect data, breaking through data bottlenecks in machine learning.


I have always been fascinated by the quest to understand the interpretability of artificial neural networks and the human brain.
