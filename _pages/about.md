# About me

I am a PhD student at [Sydney Artificial Intelligence Centre](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/data-science-and-computer-engineering/ubtech-sydney-artificial-intelligence-centre.html), The University of Sydney, supervised by [Prof. Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io). 

I have always been fascinated by the quest to understand the interpretability of artificial neural networks and the human brain. Lately, my primary focus has been on "Generalization in Deep Learning within Constrained Environments."
